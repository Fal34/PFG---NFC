Only decades ago, it was really hard to communicate people telematicaly with each other, even transmit voice was impressive. Nowadays we have the opportunity to make a movement anywhere and put you in contact with someone at hundred or even thousands kilometers. This shows how the communications have evolved in an incredible way. The security on these communications is essential. Due to this, implementing cryptographic systems is vital to preserve the users and content privacy.

Cryptography has evolved at a fast pace since 1980 and during last century its progress has follow a huge rise as communication systems did. From the most primitive methods of letter trans- position to high complexity cryptographic systems (cryptosystems), the goal is to  preserve a nice security level without spending a lot of resources (time and storage resources). It is essential to optimize the resources to be competitive; cryptosystems based on elliptic curves cut down noticeably the storage needs compare to others.

Going in the same direction, the NFC technology (Near Field Com- munication) has simplified the communication devices, building cheaper and smaller ones. This technology has conquer the world with a lot of applications. On this bachelor thesis, we propose a solution to make secure systems with low-cost communication devices and advanced cryptography. Furthermore, we have programmed a smartphone application which let the user to make and use a NFC tag as high security authentication device on a made-up system.
